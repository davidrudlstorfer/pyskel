PySkel is a quick-start Python repository to act as a skeleton for various projects which includes the following amenities:

- [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/) testing framework including an enforced minimum coverage check
- Automated [Github CI/CD](https://resources.github.com/devops/ci-cd/)
- Exhaustive [Pre-Commit](https://pre-commit.com) framework to automatically check code formatting and code quality
- Automatically generated [Documentation](https://pdoc.dev) based on the included Python docstrings
- Pre-defined framework to gather global settings (see [`main_example_config.yaml`](./src/pyskel/main_example_config.yaml)) and execute a specific workflow
- Adjusted global logger with optional output to the commandline and/or log file

## Installation

For a quick and easy start an Anaconda/Miniconda environment is highly recommended. Other ways to install PySkel are possible but here the installation procedure is explained based on a conda install. After installing Anaconda/Miniconda
execute the following steps:

- Create a new Anaconda environment based on the [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml) file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

- Activate your newly created environment:
```
conda activate pyskel
```
- All necessary third party libraries can be installed using:
```
pip install -e .
```
- Finally, install the pre-commit hook with:
```
pre-commit install
```

Now you are up and running üéâ

## Execution

To execute PySkel either run

```
pyskel
````

to execute PySkel with the provided exemplary config or use

```
pyskel --config_file_path ../path/to/config.yaml
````

to utilize your own externally provided config file. Therein, all necessary configurations can be found.

### Run testing framework and create coverage report

To locally execute the tests and create the html coverage report simply run

```
pytest
```

### Create documentation

To locally create the documentation from the provided docstrings simply run

```
pdoc --html --output-dir docs src/
```

## Dependency Management

To ease the dependency update process [`pip-tools`](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) is utilized. To create the necessary [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) file simply execute

```
pip-compile --all-extras --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in
````

To upgrade the dependencies simply execute

```
pip-compile --all-extras --output-file=requirements.txt --upgrade requirements.in
````

Finally, perforfmance critical packages such as Numpy and Numba are installed via conda to utilize BLAS libraries.
